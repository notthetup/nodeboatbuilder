### Aim

Let's Make something! Inspired by [NodeBoats at JSConf](http://makezine.com/2014/06/02/turning-coders-into-makers-at-jsconf-2014/)

Let's build boats that can be controlled by web technologies. We will make boats that can communicate over WiFi to a Node app.

The exact design of the boat and the control will be up to the individual team's creativity.

### Teams
